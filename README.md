# java_final_project# Final Project

This is the final project for my CIS-171 Java course at Kirkwood Community College. Below is a journal of all the things I learned throughout the class.

## Introduction

During our first week in class we mainly learned about Git and Github. After talking with a friend who works in the coding field about github I found out that it, or a renamed version of it, is a fairly common thing in the work place. Our main focus was on memorizing the commands for git to put our repository onto Github. Such as adding committing and pushing.
 
One of the things that I also found really interesting was how easy it made sharing code. Instead of zipping the file or copy and pasting a whole block of code, I could simply copy and paste a link to my repository.

## Chapter 1

Our Main focus for chapter one was on creating variables and getting user input. Creating variables in Java is very similar to that of creating variables in python. However, in creating a variable in Java you have to declare the data type. I can see this as both a blessing and a curse mainly due to the fact of numbers. You cannot cross an ints and doubles. However if a user inputs an int, let's say 5, into a double variable it turns it into 5.0. Yet it doesn’t do it the other way around. That makes me wonder why you wouldn’t always use doubles.
